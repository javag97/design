SLO Donut Co. is a popular donut shop located about two miles from Cal Poly’s campus. When I walked into SLODoCo and talked to the manager, she mentioned that SLODoCo brings in about $200,000 of revenue every month. It comes to no surprise that this business knows how to attract people and has built a very successful business because of that. 

With increasing popularity, however,  the business has found itself with issues. During peak hours, it is not uncommon to see people waiting in lines out the door for as long as an hour just to order a single donut. After spending time in line and finding out that their favorite donut is out of stock, they either order another donut or end up buying nothing at all. To the consumer, it is a waste of effort and time. In this interaction, there is both a tangible and intangible cost to their business. 


Before starting the design process, it is important to realize the interactions between a business and its customers. Without this,we are not designing with the users in mind. We are merely hoping that the design will make the interaction better. This can all be displayed in detail through this Business Model Canvas. 

In interacting with managers, employees, and customers of SLODOCO, these are the important takeaways.
SLODOCO makes the most amount of money from tourists, locals, and college students
SLODOCO looks to make the entire experience of buying a donut as effortless as possible
Quality ingredients lead to quality donuts
Socializing with others improves this experience
It is important to include smaller customer segments (free wifi, dietary needs, etc) 
Based on where SLODOCO makes the most revenue, it would make the most sense to interview someone from every customer segment. However, It would take too much time and effort to collect data quantitatively. In order to get data that is representative of the population,  qualitative data will be collected at different times throughout the day. 

The research reaffirmed our beliefs that SLODoCo’s target demographic does not like spend time waiting in line. This demographic is typically health and community oriented. Such customers of SLODoCo don’t regularly eat donuts, but rather enjoy the experience that comes with a trendy brand. 

After creating personas that match the target audience, it became clear that the brand that SLODoCo has built is crucial to their success. People like to socialize with friend, take photos of their donuts, enjoy the local band, play board games; people are very delighted by having a space that facilitates this. Finally, customers are more likely to come regularly if deals are more frequent.  This is true even for community members who have a more stable source of income. 

Using our findings, a prototype was created and then assessed with a usability study. Using this lean approach and a low-fidelity prototype allowed for immediate feedback. This information was used to create a high-fidelity prototype.
