Datum
noun
a piece of information.
a fixed starting point of a scale or operation.

In the aerospace industry, parts that malfunction during launch are a serious problem. Datum was a startup idea inspired by building a funnel for high quality suppliers and aerospace businesses. Organizations like SpaceX, JPL, and Boeing have issues with having access to parts that are in conformance to their requirements. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 is a prime example of how one faulty part led to total loss of spacecraft. 

Through 30 customer development surveys, it was found that the most common method that big companies contact their suppliers is through cold calling. It is also common for companies to keep internal contacts, but employees would rather focus on real engineering work that maintaining good relations with contacts. This market niche has no real solutions to this very important problem.

This is the MVP that was created for StartUp Weekend. 



Barriers. Challenges. 

As the team’s only pure designer, I felt the pressure to excel for my team. Colin was a SpaceX employee that had been in the industry for a couple of years. Forrest was a Software Engineer after pivoting his career from finance. 




In the summer of 2017, I participated in Startup Weekend Santa Barbara. These events are essentially multi-day hackathons for people looking to start a business. I was really scared to participate in this for various reasons. Firstly, I was essentially going to this event without a place to sleep at night. I had gone by myself, and I had very little design experience. Despite these obstacles, I went on to join a team as the only designer and stayed with one of my teammates who had a place to stay in Santa Barbara. I worked with a great group that went on to earn second place in the competition.
