# Summary
While working as a developer, our team realized that we needed to improve our documentation for various components. Our solution was to work upon Astrum, an open source pattern library that could be worked into our current site.


# Role
Throughout the summer, I was the a student web developer who undertook web design responsibilities.

+ [Lauren Barker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weblbdesigns/) - Full Stack Developer
+ [Carlos Paz]() â€“ Student Developer
+ [Tyler Ratchod]() - Student Developer
  
# Increasing web browser support
 I worked within dining services and started by increasing Internet Explorer 9+ support for card components. Our motivation was to improve support among a decent percentage of users who were viewing the site (most likely parents and staff). 
 
# Designing and developing a page 
I worked within designing and developing a page that would show if our site ever had server issues that would cause the dining site to fail.

# The Cookbook as a Jekyll page 
From talking to my boss, we wanted to look into trying to consolidate our work at one place.


# Decisions
I have to talk to Lauren again to get information :-(, but
Patternlab had difficulies being worked into our current build process. A solution that was less opinionated and lighter in size was what we were looking for. based on our criteria, We choose Astrum, an open source pattern library.

# Benefits 
1. We can focus on workflows and logic, not hero blocks and form elements.
2. We can reuse code instead of reinventing the wheel. If a new component is required, we can add it here for future use.
3. We can see all of our styles and patterns in one place, quickly revealing maintenance issues.
