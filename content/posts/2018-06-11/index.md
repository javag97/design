# Role
Throughout this project, I was the a web developer who undertook design responsibilities as we had no designers.

# Context
The Cal Poly Corporation is an umbrella business that provides financial assisance to raining money for the university. Within my experience, I worked within dining services and started by increasing Internet Explorer 9+ support for card components. From talking to my boss, we wanted to look into trying to consolidate our work at one place.


# Decisions

# Benefits 
1. We can focus on workflows and logic, not hero blocks and form elements.
2. We can reuse code instead of reinventing the wheel. If a new component is required, we can add it here for future use.
3. We can see all of our styles and patterns in one place, quickly revealing maintenance issues.
