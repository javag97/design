# Context

These events are essentially multi-day hackathons for people looking to start a business. I was really scared to participate in this for various reasons. Firstly, I was essentially going to this event without a place to sleep at night. I had gone by myself, and I had very little design experience. Despite these obstacles, I went on to join a team as the only designer and stayed with one of my teammates who had a place to stay in Santa Barbara. I worked with a great group that went on to earn second place in the competition.

# Customer Development 
 We got contacts through Collin. Collin called about 10 individuals who work in aerospace and found that big companies find suppliers through cold calling.
