more likely to keep costs low. This, however, does
take more effort to remain informed on pricing.

products
Optimization and Economies of Scale:
• At the start of every month, the ingredients are

# For whom are we creating value?

• Positive work environment
• Building relationships with customers
• Making the donuts to quality standards
• Delivering the donuts in a professional manner
Our Distribution Channels?
• Currently local in San Luis Obispo but looking to expand North
Customer Relationships?
• Good customer service and friendly attitude to keep customers
coming back
Revenue streams?
• Disproportionately donut sales. T-shirts, drinks, etc. make of a
very small part of revenue
Production:
• The company depends on having high quality donuts that people
are willing to pay money for. It also has to make sure that the
specialty donuts are worth the trouble as they are often much
more difficult to get informed about and then make.

decide what special donuts are going to be
made.
Reduction of Risk and Uncertainty:
• Since the brand is well defined and the company
has been in business for a while, there is always a
steady stream of customers. It is more important
to the business that they do not run out of
materials. Since the business has logs of what has
been sold in given months in the past, they can
estimate how much will be needed at a given
time. For emergencies, it is nice to always have
5-7 extra bags of flour at any given time.
Motivations for partnerships:
• Since there is no loyalty, they can choose to order
as much as they need. In July, the amount of flour
needed is different than in September.
Acquisition of particular resources and activities:
• Recipes for specialty donuts can be taken off the
internet.

Is your business more Cost Driven or Value Driven?

Variable Costs:
• Specials on materials
• Unique donuts
• Insurance
• Workers
• Orders
Economies of Scale:
• Ordering raw materials in bulk as suppliers sell these at lower costs
Economies of Scope:
• Having a variety of donuts at a given time

• More value driven: focuses on creating quality products that please customers. Always coming up with
new creative donuts to keep customers coming back
Fixed Costs:
• Workers salaries - minimum wage
• Wireless Internet
• Water
• Nitrogen

Revenue Streams
For what value are our customers really willing to pay?
• The cost that the donuts are at now- mostly college students,
so prices staying low is key
For what do they currently pay?
• Prices range for donuts but around $2 per donut
How are they currently paying?
• Cash or credit is allowed
How would they prefer to pay?
• Cash or credit
How much does each Revenue Stream contribute to overall
revenues?
• Slo Do Co. makes approximately $200,000 in revenue on any
given month.
• According to the manager, over 90% are just donut sales.

Advertising:
• Yellow Pages, social media
• Different companies featuring them (ex. TASTE!,
magazines, etc.)
• Partnerships on certain drinks, milk, vitamin water, etc.
Fixed pricing:
• Not at all, $1.10 - $3 for most regular items
List price:
• Menu that people read off of, tend to stay the same for
the most part
Product Feature Dependent:
• More options, thai tea, unique donuts, vibe of the shop,
studying space 24 hours, close proximity to campus
Customer Segment Dependent:
• Dependent on college students, but can still make it
during the summer
• Locals, tourist, students depend on nighttime

Volume Dependent:
• People tend to buy a couple of
donuts, dozens are common and
are discounted compared to
buying each donut individually
Dynamic Pricing:
• Pricing is only affected when
certain types of donuts do not
sell well
Yield Management:
• Prices are increased for things
that are in limited supply.
• Certain specialty donuts that are
popular

• Rent

WHY?

“The user wants to be able
to know when their favorite
donuts are fresh and available
or when the location is full of
customers.”

“Because sometimes SloDoCo
runs out of some donuts really
fast and people would like to
know beforehand.”

“So people can plan their trip to
SloDoCo accordingly.”

“Because it can sometimes be a
waste of time.”

“Because people can be busy and just want to grab a bite to eat and

“In terms of responses, we were able to figure out which donuts are prefered during each
time of day. As I thought, the regular donuts are mostly wanted in the morning or at anytime,
specialty donuts are wanted more in the afternoon, and the dessert donuts are preferred either

Environment:

» At home in room, quiet/calm environment
» Interview time: 12 PM

Leading Questions:

How did you hear about the website?
»» “Looked up company online-was curious.”

How often do you use Slodoco’s website?

Do you find yourself more inclined to go to Slodoco after using their
website?

» “Made her hungry- especially the main page rainbow donut picture.”
» “However, she stated that the instagram page made her even more hungry-the pictures were
more fun and better represented the fun and happy environment she remembers experiencing
when going to SloDoCo.”

After using their website, do you feel anything is missing from it?

When are you most inclined to use the website? (time of day, level of
hunger)

» “She was confused by the custom order site and suggested there should be a tab just called
“order” where people can select specific donuts they desire and place them in their cart or
“box” that way this would simplify the order process and people would not have to call.”
» “Confused by the July page- should have something that explains Slodoco makesmonthly
specials.”
» “Do they do deliveries or not?”

Why do you use the website? (to look up events, new donuts, custom
orders, hours, etc)

Common Habits/Observations:

» “Only used a couple times.”

» “If I was ordering something, wanted a box.”
» “More inclined to use Instagram.”

» “If I was ordering something, or wanted a box of donuts and wanted to see what donuts were
available.”

» “Interactive links at bottom that take you to their other social media platforms.”
» “Simple design of the overall website.”

What do you think could be improved about the website?

» “No prices were shown anywhere- needs to have prices on donuts/etc.”
» “Menu page was way too long “felt like I was scrolling on forever and became disinterested,
however what if the donut I had wanted was at the very end.”
» “Thinks there should be categories for each type of donuts displayed, where you can click on
the category and then see more options for those types - simplify main page and make more
appealing.”
» “Confused on if they deliver or not- only saw custom orders- confused by it.”

GROUP 5 | SLODOCO TO GO | UX CASE STUDY

» Likes the first picture that pops up.
» First scrolls down to pictures below and clicks on the facebook image that takes her to the
facebook page- not what she expected or wanted.
» “Making me hungry looking at all of these donuts.”
» Tries clicking bottom words of menu such as “donut holes, gluten free, vegan cake” but was
upset to find they don’t lead to any new page or pictures.
» Surprised by the fact that they do custom donuts that you can pick the design for yourself
wanted to know more about it.
» *clicks SloDoCo logo to go back to main page*

orders, hours, etc)
» “To look up different donuts, or specialty donuts to see what she is in the mood for.”

What do you like about the website?

Do you find yourself more inclined to go to Slodoco after using their
website?
» “YES. It’s almost impossible for her to resist going to Slodoco after visiting their website.
Especially when she is hungry.”

After using their website, do you feel anything is missing from it?

» “Besides donut prices, and records of how many donuts are available in the store, nothing
really.”
» “Maybe something that gives coupons or incentivizes her to go to slodoco more that she
normally would, like if there was a deal or some special going on, they should advertise it on
their website.”

Common Habits/Observations:
»
»
»
»
»
»

Clicks around on a lot of different pictures on the website that are not interactive.
Confused on how to get back to the main page.
Surprised by the custom order section-didn’t know that was a possibility.
Constantly would toggle back between working on homework page and SloDoCo’s website.
Stated aloud how she was getting really hungry.
Went on their instagram page on her phone as well to look up more donuts.

» “She loves all of the pictures of the donuts that are provided- they usually persuade her to drive
over to slodoco and buy a donut.”

What do you think could be improved about the website?

» “She wishes she could click on each of the individual donuts and find out more information such
as the price of the donut or maybe how many they have in the store at that time.”
» “She states how she is always bummed out when she goes to Slodoco at night to find out a lot
of the donuts she likes are gone, so maybe if there was a way to keep track of which donuts they
had in the store and communicate it to users online, that would be cool!”

Bio

Jeff is a struggling Architecture student who is attending Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo. He spends most of his time in his architecture studio
cranking out his projects and making sure they’re the highest of craft
and quality. He loves food and loves going out and trying new places
in the SLO area. Since he’s up so late, he loves SloDoCo, especially
since it’s relatively close to the architecture studios. He uses the
SloDoCo app constantly to see if the shop is filled with his favorite
donuts and to see if it’s full of people so he can chill and take a break
from Studio. He’s constantly trying their new special donuts and loves
bringing some back for his Studiomates!

SCENARIOS
Loyalty + Coupon Scenario
Clare Smith is a single mother of three in her thirties who is a
San Luis Obispo local. She and her children love SloDoCo and
she often treats the family to donuts every Friday after school.
Clare usually does not like to spend money, however she finds
it is worth it to spend this money every week. Clare recently
downloaded the SloDoCo app and was surprised to see that
it had a section that offers coupons and deals. She also was
delighted to find that there was a loyalty program within the
app. The first Friday after downloading the app, Clare opens it
on her cell phone while she is waiting for her children to decide
on what to order. She then taps on the Deals tab and looks
for the best option to use with her order. Next, she tells the
employee her order and finally shows the coupon at the register.
Clare was happy that the coupon gave her a 10% discount. She
then taps on the Loyalty Program tab in the app and shows the
cashier her digital loyalty card. Clare loves this feature because
she frequents SloDoCo every week, and the card allows her to
receive a free item after purchasing six items. Finally, Clare leaves
the establishment with her children in a happy mood due to the
coupon saving her money and the loyalty program promising a
free item in the future

Donut Availability +
Store Occupancy Scenario
Jeff Campbell is a Junior Architecture student at Cal Poly
University. It is a late weeknight and he is starting to get a craving
for something sweet to eat. SloDoCo is one of his guilty pleasures
that he lets himself indulge in every so often. His absolute favorite
donut that he always gets at SloDoCo is the glazed buttermilk
donut. Nothing would bring him more joy than to go to SloDoCo
and grab one of these donuts to eat. However it is almost 12 am
and he’s worried they have run out of them. Jeff remembers he
has the SloDoCo app! He remembers that the app will allow him
to see if his favorite donut is currently in stock and will let him see
if he would have to wait in line for it. So he pulls out her phone
and opens the app. Sure enough, his hunch was correct. A bar
on the app indicated that it’s a full house due to an event and all
the donuts were gone and he now has to wait for fresh donuts.
He decides to wait and spends the rest of the time studying and
catching up on work. Then Jeff receives a notification that the
donuts are ready and he sees that the store is no longer packed.
So he heads for the shop and grabs his donut and continues to
be a happy customer.

USABILITY STUDY

Follow Up Questions:
1. What are your initial thoughts?

Connor did not have any issues with completing the first task.
He quickly pressed on the hamburger menu and then tapped on the
Menu option. He expressed how it was a bit overwhelming at first to
see a long list of donuts, but that he found the French Cruller option
quickly. Connor liked the pictures of the different donuts, and thought
that it was easy to find the Strawberry donut. It took him a moment
to figure out what the availability option was on the page, but was
ultimately able to complete the task. After completing the task, Connor
expressed how he thinks that the donut availability option is a really
great idea. He stated that he has been to SloDoCo before and that the
establishment was out of the donut he wanted, and thus it would have
been nice for him to know if it was in stock before he had driven there.
The second task did not go as smoothly as the first. Connor was
able to quickly tap on the hamburger menu, but took a few seconds to
find which option would lead him to the coupons. He explained, “At
first I looked for a section in the hamburger menu that said Coupons,
but then I saw Deals and realized that the coupons would be found
there. Once I got to the coupons it was easy to look down the list and
find the one you specified.” Connor also had a slight problem with
redeeming the coupon, as he first tapped on the surrounding area
other than the Redeem Button. He expressed how much he liked the
barcode and how easy it would be to just show it to the cashier in order
to scan it. Connor explained how overall he appreciates that it does
not take a lot of time to find and use the coupons.

Usability Testing Tasks:
1. “I thought that was the date”

availability of donuts. For example,
12/25 would be Christmas. Dom

number of donuts available if you

that would be scanned at the

PLANNING - SLODOCO TO GO

USABILITY STUDY

Test #2 - Madeline Wilson, 20 Usability Testing Tasks:
Maddie performed the first task very easily. She went to the
menu page, then selected the french cruller donut category and then
selected the strawberry donut on that page. It was all a very quick
and smooth process and she seemed to be able to navigate through
the app fairly easily. One topic Maddie brought up that I thought was
important to cover is that she was curious how she would be notified
by the app. “Would I get text messages or would they pop up on the
app notifications”. She was also curious whether or not there was an
option for turning these notifications off if she no longer wanted them.
For the second task, Maddie had an issue finding out where to
go. She went to the home page, however at a quick glance, she did
not see the deals page so she clicked on the menu page and started
searching around there and got a little bit lost. She then decided to go
back to the main page and finally was able to see the deals page. Once
on that page, she easily was able to find the custom order deal and
select it. This is something that we can definitely change to make out
prototype better. Something about the main page layout needs to be
changed so that it is easier to navigate. This could potentially come in
the design phase with different colors or logos to help users better see
and differentiate between the categories.

Follow Up Questions:

Test #4 - Matthew Fajardo, 21
Usability Testing Tasks:

The first task in this usability test was to search for the availability of the Strawberry French
Cruller’s on the app. Matthew didn’t have a problem with this task, he explained to me how it was
easy to navigate the prototype, especially the menu section of the app. He got through to the French
Cruller section of the menu section and expressed his thoughts about it. Upon looking at the screen,
I asked him what he thought the information of this screen meant. He told me that the “12/25” was
kind of confusing and looked more like a date than a availability counter. He also tapped around on
this screen and saw the box to notify him, he expected a window to pop up telling him that he’ll be
notified, but it didn’t happen. That’s definitely something good to know and will be added when we
refine the design. Other than that, he completed that task fairly quickly.
For the second task, it took him a bit longer, but didn’t have too much of a problem with it.
This task asked him to find a coupon that was awarded to him on the app. From the French Cruller
screen, he tapped on the hamburger icon and scanned the available options. He assumed in order
to receive deals he would have to apply for them, so he tapped on the “Apply” tab. From there he
was confused as to what he was applying to and decided to tap out of this screen. This is something
we can definitely add an explanation to when we refine the app. With only one tab that hasn’t been
explored, he tapped on the “Deals” tab and found the coupons screen. He explained that he liked
the way the screen looked on the prototype, but was just confused as to why the social media icons
were included on this screen and nowhere else. Next he clicked on the redeem button for the Free
Custom Order and said that the barcode was a good touch and that it was simple and clean. Other
than that, he completed this task fairly quickly, similar to the first task.

Follow Up Questions:
1. What are your initial thoughts?

» “The usability of this app are great and would benefit the company. The prototype was
fairly easy to use and navigate. There are a few things that are weird and need improving,
but will be simple to improve.”

2. How do you feel about navigating throughout the app?

USABILITY STUDY, OUR FINDINGS
Most troubling areas:

For the second usability test we
asked our test takers to look for
the coupons, but people had
trouble finding it since the word
“coupon” wasn’t anywhere in
the menu. It’s located in the
“deals” tab.
Suggestion: Have a separate
tab for “coupons” and
“deals.”

For this first usability test, we
had our testers find a specific
donut and tell us what its
availability. Some testers felt
that the menu screen was
overwhleming with the larger
list of donuts.
Suggestion: Make it not
look like a long list, maybe
separate into boxes.

While completeing the second
usability test, we asked them
to play around with this screen.
Some testers seemed to tap on
places other than redeem to
view the coupon.
Suggestion: Make the whole
coupon box clickable to direct
to the coupon.

Add “Coupons” tab

During the first usability test,
once the tester finds the donut
we were asking for, they had a
chance to look around on this
screen. Most thought the donut
counter listed as “12/25” was a
date instead of a counter. Also,
some tapped the notify box and
expected another window to
pop up.

Suggestion: Make the counter
look more like a counter and
have a confirmation window
that tells them they’ll be
notified.

opening app
menu.

For this test, it seems that people understand how to navigate
the prototype to find the donuts they need.


For this test, it seems that people have a hard time navigating
to get to a different menu. Also it seems that we should make
coupons its own tab.
