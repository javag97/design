An augmented reality mobile app to learn more about culture and art while traveling.

# Role
I was involved in designing an impactful mobile app experience from start to finish. This was a personal project.

# Context

Any laymen person would be able to tell you in an instant where the subject of the first photograph is. A local resident from London might be able to tell you that they pass by the artwork in the second photograph everyday on their morning commute to work. London is one of the most commonly visited locations in the world with [thirty million visitors annually](http://www.uncsbrp.org/tourism.htm). Yet, only a handful of people could tell you how this mural came to be. 

Our app's goal is to promote the celebration of culture and spirit of artistry. We believe that the art of a society reflects a lot about the society itself. By allowing others to discover local art, the hope is that other people can be more aware of their own culture. 

# Problem

![Venn Diagram showing disconnect between tourists and locals](./images/problem.jpg)

People spend lots of time hovering around “tourist traps” when traveling rather than trying to experience the area from the point of view of locals. This leads people to thinking that tourist attractions fully represent the people who live in these cities. This is not to say that popular tourist attractions don't represent an area, but that there is more to a destination than the tourism.

# Background Research

*Note: To comply with non-disclosure, I have omitted and obfuscated confidential information.*

We asked the following questions to five different individuals regarding their travels. The reasoning was to validate the idea that travelers often overlook certain destinations that locals very frequently congregate behind. 

## Questions 
+ Tell me a little bit about where you’re from.
+ How connected you feel to your local community?
+ Tell me about less known places that you like to visit locally. 
+ How important is a cultural expression to you?
+ How often do you travel?
+ How much do you plan when you travel?
+ How do you balance local culture and tourist attractions?
+ What do you enjoy about artistic attractions?

From speaking with real people, we discovered a generalized but real viewpoint that could be found across potential users of our concept. 

+ Spending too much time around tourist destinations can feel constructed
+ Balance of both tourist destinations and non-tourist destinations 
+ People take pride in their community

# Defining public art

![Images of what public art for the purposes of StArt](./images/definingart.jpg)
When talking to different people, we were faced with a challenge of what to include when making the app. A remark made when explaining our idea to research participants was to expand the idea to a travel app that tourists can use when traveling overall. Another research participant mentioned expanding public art to art that can be found in museums.

The decision to keep the app specifically in the direction of public art is to give users the opporunity to explore art duing their downtime. We also felt it important for art to be publicly accessible as we felt public art reflects the ideas of an area more so than art in a museum.

# Audience
Our decision was to limit to scope as we wanted the app to be as focused on a user as possible.  We also were aware of other competitors in the space that currently suceessful, while looking at our idea as a way to solve the problems of a single fictional person whose needs could be clearly identified and monitored.

Such an individual is excited about different cultures. They travel often and are looking at experiencing cultures and communities different from their own. These experiences can be found in any range from large metropolitan areas to small towns.

# Persona

![Our fictional persona](./images/jeremy.jpg)

## “I feel like I’m missing out on the authentic culture of the places I travel.”

Jeremy Wilkes is a 24-year-old student teacher who does wedding photography on the side. Jeremy enjoys going on road trips with friends on weekends and during his time off. When he gets the chance he also likes to travel abroad with his family. When Jeremy and his family travel they like to leave some time to do some free-form exploring.

### Goals 
+ Learn more about the authentic culture in the places he visits.
+ Wants to meet new kinds of people when he goes on trips.
+ Wants to explore new things in places he hasn't been before
+ Wants to share his experience within his circle of friends and family
+ Wants to keep track of all the places he’s visited.
+ Doesn’t want to spend a lot of money to experience the places he visits


# Scenario

1. Jeremy is in Phoenix, AZ for a photography gig over the weekend and has some down time before it starts.
2. He wants to experience the local culture but not spend any money. 
3. He’s downtown and doesn’t have a plan for what to do.
4. Jeremy pulls out his phone and opens the StArt mobile app.
5. Based on location, StArt lists local street art nearby.
6. The map on his phone directs him to art a couple blocks away from the tourist area.
7. Jeremy finds the cool mural of Muhammad Ali, a local resident, on the side of a shop.
8. The app congratulates Jeremy for finding the mural. The app describes the history of the mural and Jeremy is fascinated by Ali’s impact on the area.
9. Jeremy uses AR to sign his name. He wants to leave his mark without disrespecting the artist of the mural.
10. Jeremy notices that the street he’s on has some other interesting displays and shops. Jeremy looks for other nearby art to kill more of his time.

# Interaction framework
This is based on the goals of Jeremy.

# Wireframes

# Usability testing

We tested our wireframe on four different individuals to receive feedback on basic interaction. To provide consistency between usability testing, we took a sample script written by Steve Krug ([found here](https://www.sensible.com/downloads/test-script.pdf)) and asked participants to complete three tasks. 

## Tasks

+ You have a couple hours to kill before the event starts. Try to find the nearest artwork near you.
+ After finding the nearest artwork, You want to leave your mark and make sure that other users can see your creation. Sign your name in AR.
+ You’ve been exploring for a couple hours now and you want to see a list of what art pieces you’ve seen. Try to find a mosaic that you visited on January 23rd.

## Results

From three usability tests, we could see that our first two tasks of our interface were easy to follow. However, people were hung up on our third task. We noticed that when all of our participants were asked to look for an item on a list, their natural response was is to scroll. The way we had structured our interface was that users would sort to find past discoveries as we were convinced that [users wouldn't scroll](https://uxmyths.com/post/654047943/myth-people-dont-scroll).  

![Usability Results](./images/usability-changes.jpg)

Our first change was to make this screen default to sort by date. A sort button with a drop down was allows users to click on this button if they want to sort, then prompting users about what way they would want to sort. The reasoning for this decision is that that users looking to sort will want to do so. From testing our third task again, our users were able to finish the task.

# Closing Thoughts
In future versions, users should be able to see other user’s photos and tags within AR. It would also be important for app’s purpose of celebrating art to have artists being more directly involved with adding their art to the app.

## Ethical Considerations
Although the app is all meant to be publicly accessible the artist may feel that it violates their usage rights as the creator of an image. Since it is also meant to bring people to areas that they would not normally explore it may increase tourist presence in an area that doesn’t want tourism.

## AR Kit and technical limitations
Apple's ARKit in its current form can currently support the app as designed. However, such a technology is still new and could be improved upon. A challenge is finding a way for others to see tags made on different devices. Such a system must be developed that allows shared viewing across the AR Space. 


## Constraints
It is important to consider the process of how users submit art locations to travel to.
This process can be open to all users or a select few to be able to moderate content. In the case that someone
uploads inappropriate imagery or text, there needs to be a system for reporting which should be accounted for in the app's design.
