# Situation
For a Mobile UX Design course, I was tasked with designing a mobile application that involved an emerging technology. Our end product was an app to promote the celeration of culture and spirit of artistry. We achieved this by connecting travelers to local street art. 


## Roles
In this project, I  collaborated with [Anna Shambaugh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-shambaugh/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top%3BDHyLxgxGQlKAmE3smEDQJw%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top-search_srp_result&lici=hEqIYOcPSP%2Bx23GMhJUXaQ%3D%3D) in research and ideation. I took charge in interaction and visual design as I had more experience.

# Objective
![Two photos of London side by side.](./images/london-perspectives.jpg)

Most tourists characterize London with its iconic cityspace. While that image is deeply ingrained, it is not very representative of what happens within the city. To various locals, their perception of London is shaped by what they see on their daily commute. While both viewpoints are valid, it is crucioal to acknowledge how these viewpoints often conflict with each other.

## Problem
![Venn Diagram showing the disconnect between tourists and locals](./images/problem.jpg)

"Tourist traps" currently concentrate tourism foot traffic and spending within small areas. This can negatively affect the local community and lead to a set of unintended consequences. 


## Goals
+ Decrease disconnect between tourism and local life
+ Encourage travelers to be environmentally and socially conscious during travel

## Street art as a medium   
![Images of what public art for the purposes of StArt](./images/definingart.jpg)

Art reflects the values of the people whom encompass that community. A potential solution to the problem is to make tourism feel more authentic by exploring street art.

# Action

## Structured Interviews

*Note: To follow non-disclosure agreement, I have omitted and obfuscated confidential information.*

I asked the following questions to five different individuals about their travels. We wanted to confirm that travelers often overlook destinations that locals congregate behind. 

### General Findings

+ Participants agree that spending too much time around tourist destinations can feel fake
+ Participants take tremendous pride in their community
+ Participants claim to want a mix of tourism and non-tourist destinations
+ Partipicants made comments about expanding idea to travel app or to include museums

## “I’m missing out on the authentic culture of the places I travel.” —Jeremy

### Jeremy's goals
+ Become more cultured by exploring new places
+ Meet new kinds of people 
+ Share his experience within his close friends

## Desired Outcomes

+ Minimze boredom while traveling
+ Increase number of "real" places visited
+ Keep track of the destinations traveled

### Initial Sketches

## Usability testing
We asked four different users to complete three different tasks. One of the three tasks was confusing to users. This was based on our misconception that users [ don't like to scroll](https://uxmyths.com/post/654047943/myth-people-dont-scroll). 

![Usability Changes](./images/usability-changes.jpg)

Or changes was to make this screen default to sort by date. Also, a sort button with a drop-down gives users control of how they want to sort. From testing our third task again, our users were able to finish the task.


### Visual language suggestions

Direction 1

Direction 2
![Proposal 2.](./images/visual-language-2.jpg)


Users spend most of their time on other applications. We can use other existing design patterns to guide our process. Material Design and Pokémon Go inspired the visual language. Material Design has a far reach that many users have come across. Pokemon Go is a similar domain of augmented reality. This process was about adapting what currently exists to StArt.

# Results 

## First round of changes
From both iterations, we wanted to be more expressive as the app must resonate with people who are fans of art. This can be difficult when trying to also follow common design patterns elsewhere.

# Aftermath

## Future iterations
In future versions, users should be able to see other user’s photos and tags within AR. It would also be important to have artists being more involved with adding their art to the app.

## Ethical considerations
1. Artist may feel that our app violates their usage rights as the creator of an image. An artist should have a say whether their work gets displayed on the app. 
2. We have to consider what would happen to coomunities that don't want people in their space. 
3. How would we go about monitoring ”inappropriate” art without trying to censor different perspectives? This is an important question that needs lots of consideration.

## Technical limitations
How can we people be able to interact with doodles made by others? At the time of the project, Apple's ARKit can support the app as designed, but Android devices need futher development.
