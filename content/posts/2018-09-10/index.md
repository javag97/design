An augmented reality mobile app to learn more about culture and art while traveling.

<!-- end -->

Our app's vision is to promote the celebration of culture and spirit of artistry. We want to connect travelers to local art in an effort to make our world more aware of other's culture.

# Role
I designed an impactful mobile app experience from start to finish. This was a school project.

# Context

Any laymen person would be able to tell you in an instant where the subject of the first photograph is. A local from London might tell you that they pass by the second photograph on their morning commute. London is one of the most visited locations in the world with [thirty million annual visitors](http://www.uncsbrp.org/tourism.htm). Yet, only a handful of people could tell you how this mural came to be. 



# Problem

![Venn Diagram showing the disconnect between tourists and locals](./images/problem.jpg)

There is a disconnect between what tourists and locals do. People spend lots of time hovering around “tourist traps” when traveling. As a consequence, tourists can concentrate foot-traffic within areas that negatively affect locals. This is in contrast to travelers who try to understand the area from the point of view of locals. Such travelers are more open to respecting the world around them. 

# Research

*Note: To follow non-disclosure agreement, I have omitted and obfuscated confidential information.*

We asked the following questions to five different individuals about their travels. We wanted to confirm that travelers often overlook destinations that locals congregate behind. 

## Questions 
+ Tell me a little bit about where you’re from.
+ How connected you feel to your local community?
+ What locations that aren't well known to outsiders do you like to visit? 
+ How important is a cultural expression to you?
+ How often do you travel?
+ How much do you plan when you travel?
+ How do you balance local culture and tourist attractions?
+ What do you enjoy about artistic attractions?

From speaking with real people, we discovered these general findings.

+ Spending too much time around tourist destinations can feel constructed
+ Balance of both tourist destinations and non-tourist destinations 
+ People take pride in their community

# Defining public art

![Images of what public art for the purposes of StArt](./images/definingart.jpg)
When talking to different people, we faced a challenge of what to include when making the app. A suggestion involved expanding public art to art found in museums.

We decided to keep the app in the direction of public art. By keeping the demographic specific, this allows for flexibility to not compromise usability. It was also important for art to be accessible without payment. From our feedback, we thought art in the public better reflects ideas of an area more so than art in a museum.

# Audience

Many comments made was to expand the idea to a travel app that tourists can use when traveling. But, there are other competitors currently successful in that market. Our decision was to limit to scope as we wanted the app to be as focused on a user as possible.

Such individuals find different cultures exciting. They travel often and are looking at experiencing communities different from their own. These individuals can find themselves between large metropolitan areas and small towns.

# Persona

![Our fictional persona](./images/jeremy.jpg)

## “I’m missing out on the authentic culture of the places I travel.”

Jeremy Wilkes is a 24-year-old student teacher. He is also a part-time wedding photographer as a way to supplement his income. Jeremy enjoys going on road trips with friends on weekends and during his time off. When he gets the chance he also likes to travel abroad with his family. When Jeremy and his family travel they like to leave some time to do some free-form exploring.

### Jeremy's goals
+ Learn more about the authentic culture in the places he visits.
+ Wants to meet new kinds of people when he goes on trips.
+ Wants to explore new things in places he hasn't been before
+ Wants to share his experience within his circle of friends and family
+ Wants to keep track of all the places he’s visited.
+ Doesn’t want to spend a lot of money to experience the places he visits


# Scenario

1. Jeremy is in Phoenix, AZ for a photography gig over the weekend.
2. He wants to experience the local culture but not spend any money. 
3. Jeremy pulls out his phone and StArt lists local street art nearby.
4. The map on his phone directs him to art a couple blocks away.
5. Jeremy finds the cool mural of Muhammad Ali, a local resident, on the side of a shop.
6. The app congratulates Jeremy for finding the mural. The app describes the history of the mural.
7. Ali’s impact on the area fascinates Jeremy.
8. Jeremy uses AR to sign his name. He wants to leave his mark without disrespecting the artist.
9. Jeremy notices that the street he’s on has some other interesting displays and shops. Jeremy looks for other nearby art to kill more time.

# Interaction framework

# Usability testing
We used an [adapted sample script](https://www.sensible.com/downloads/test-script.pdf) to provide consistency between usability testing.  Four different individuals gave feedback to our wireframe. We asked them to complete three different tasks. 

## Tasks

+ You have a couple hours to kill before the event starts. Try to find the nearest artwork near you.
+ You want to leave your mark and make sure that other users can see your creation. Sign your name in AR.
+ You’ve been exploring for a couple hours now and you want to see a list of what art pieces you’ve seen. Try to find a mosaic that you visited on January 23rd.

## Results

From three usability tests, we could see that our first two tasks of our interface were easy to follow. Yet, our third task was confusing to participants. 

When our participants looked for an item on a list, we expected them to understand pagination. Instead, their natural response was to [scroll and not sort](https://uxmyths.com/post/654047943/myth-people-dont-scroll). 

![Usability Results](./images/usability-changes.jpg)

Or changes was to make this screen default to sort by date. Also, a sort button with a drop-down gives users control of how they want to sort. From testing our third task again, our users were able to finish the task.

# Visual language suggestions
Users spend most of their time on other applications. We can use other existing design patterns to guide our process. Material Design and Pokémon Go inspired the visual language. Material Design has a far reach that many users have come across. Pokemon Go is a similar domain of augmented reality. This process was about adapting what currently exists to StArt.

# Final product
From both iterations, we wanted to be more expressive as the app must resonate with people who are fans of art. This can be difficult when trying to also follow common design patterns elsewhere.

# Future iterations
In future versions, users should be able to see other user’s photos and tags within AR. It would also be important to have artists being more involved with adding their art to the app.

## Ethical considerations
These are things that we need to keep in mind when pursuing the idea further. The artist may feel that our app violates their usage rights as the creator of an image. An artist should have a say whether their work gets displayed on the app. We also have to consider tourism in areas that don't want tourism. Finally, we should consider monitoring inappropriate art without trying to censor different perspectives. It is also important to consider who gets to say what is inappropriate. 

## ARKit and technical limitations
A challenge is finding a way for others to see tags made on different devices. Currently, Apple's ARKit can support the app as designed. Yet, such a technology is still emerging and needs to develop further across other devices.
