# Situation

 For a Mobile UX Design course I was taking, I was tasked with designing a mobile application that involved an emerging technology. Our end product was an app to promote the celeration of culture and spirit of artistry. We achieved this by connecting travelers to local street art.

Various countries create torist traps for the name of tourism. Tourists can then begin to concentrate both foot traffic and spending within small areas. This can negatively affect the community and lead to a set of unintended consequences. We listed two goals that encompass of of which we were trying to accomplish.  

+ Decrease disconnect between tourism and local life
+ Encourage travelers to be more conscious of places they travel to

## Defining public art
![Images of what public art for the purposes of StArt](./images/definingart.jpg)

From looking at various pieces of art, it was easy to find how art reflected the citizens within a community. Considering our goals, this direction warranted further exploration. 

# Action

## Structured Interviews

*Note: To follow non-disclosure agreement, I have omitted and obfuscated confidential information.*

We asked the following questions to five different individuals about their travels. We wanted to confirm that travelers often overlook destinations that locals congregate behind. 

### General Findings.

+ Spending too much time around tourist destinations can feel fake
+ Humans take tremendous pride in their community
+ Our participants claimed to want a mix of tourism destinations and non-tourist destinations

## Jeremy — Persona 

![Our fictional persona](./images/jeremy.jpg)

### “I’m missing out on the authentic culture of the places I travel.”

### Jeremy's goals
+ Become more cultured by exploring new places
+ Meet new kinds of people 
+ Share his experience within his close friends


## Activity-centered Thinking

## Tasks

+ You have a couple hours to kill before the event starts. Try to find the nearest artwork near you.
+ You want to leave your mark and make sure that other users can see your creation. Sign your name in AR.
+ You’ve been exploring for a couple hours now and you want to see a list of what art pieces you’ve seen. Try to find a mosaic that you visited on January 23rd.

### Scenario

+ Wants to keep track of all the places he’s visited.



1. Jeremy is in Phoenix, AZ for a photography gig over the weekend.
2. He wants to experience the local culture but not spend any money. 
3. Jeremy pulls out his phone and StArt lists local street art nearby.
4. The map on his phone directs him to art a couple blocks away.
5. Jeremy finds the cool mural of Muhammad Ali, a local resident, on the side of a shop.
6. The app congratulates Jeremy for finding the mural. The app describes the history of the mural.
7. Ali’s impact on the area fascinates Jeremy.
8. Jeremy uses AR to sign his name. He wants to leave his mark without disrespecting the artist.
9. Jeremy notices that the street he’s on has some other interesting displays and shops. Jeremy looks for other nearby art to kill more time.


### Interaction framework
Based on the scenario of Jeremy.

### Wireframes

### Visual language suggestions
Users spend most of their time on other applications. We can use other existing design patterns to guide our process. Material Design and Pokémon Go inspired the visual language. Material Design has a far reach that many users have come across. Pokemon Go is a similar domain of augmented reality. This process was about adapting what currently exists to StArt.

# Results 

## Usability testing
We used an [adapted sample script](https://www.sensible.com/downloads/test-script.pdf) to provide consistency between usability testing.  Four different individuals gave feedback to our wireframe. We asked them to complete three different tasks. 

From three usability tests, we could see that our first two tasks of our interface were easy to follow. Yet, our third task was confusing to participants. 

When our participants looked for an item on a list, we expected them to understand pagination. Instead, their natural response was to [scroll and not sort](https://uxmyths.com/post/654047943/myth-people-dont-scroll). 

![Usability Results](./images/usability-changes.jpg)

Or changes was to make this screen default to sort by date. Also, a sort button with a drop-down gives users control of how they want to sort. From testing our third task again, our users were able to finish the task.

## First round of changes
From both iterations, we wanted to be more expressive as the app must resonate with people who are fans of art. This can be difficult when trying to also follow common design patterns elsewhere.

# Aftermath

## Future iterations
In future versions, users should be able to see other user’s photos and tags within AR. It would also be important to have artists being more involved with adding their art to the app.

## Ethical considerations
These are things that we need to keep in mind when pursuing the idea further. The artist may feel that our app violates their usage rights as the creator of an image. An artist should have a say whether their work gets displayed on the app. We also have to consider tourism in areas that don't want tourism. Finally, we should consider monitoring inappropriate art without trying to censor different perspectives. It is also important to consider who gets to say what is inappropriate. 

## ARKit and technical limitations
A challenge is finding a way for others to see tags made on different devices. Currently, Apple's ARKit can support the app as designed. Yet, such a technology is still emerging and needs to develop further across other devices. 


## What I learned


An augmented reality mobile app to learn more about culture and art while traveling.

<!-- end -->

Our app's vision is to promote the celebration of culture and spirit of artistry. We want to connect travelers to local art in an effort to make our world more aware of other's culture.

Any laymen person would be able to tell you in an instant where the subject of the first photograph is. A local from London might tell you that they pass by the second photograph on their morning commute. London is one of the most visited locations in the world with [thirty million annual visitors](http://www.uncsbrp.org/tourism.htm). Yet, only a handful of people could tell you how this mural came to be. 


# Audience

Many comments made was to expand the idea to a travel app that tourists can use when traveling. But, there are other competitors currently successful in that market. Our decision was to limit to scope as we wanted the app to be as focused on a user as possible.

Such individuals find different cultures exciting. They travel often and are looking at experiencing communities different from their own. These individuals can find themselves between large metropolitan areas and small towns.


## free to play


When talking to different people, we faced a challenge of what to include when making the app. A suggestion involved expanding public art to art found in museums.

We decided to keep the app in the direction of public art. By keeping the demographic specific, this allows for flexibility to not compromise usability. It was also important for art to be accessible without payment. From our feedback, we thought art in the public better reflects ideas of an area more so than art in a museum.
