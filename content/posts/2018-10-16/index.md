Connecting the aerospace industry to high quality manufactoring of the 21st century.


These events are essentially multi-day hackathons for people looking to start a business. I was really scared to participate in this for various reasons. Firstly, I was essentially going to this event without a place to sleep at night. I had gone by myself, and I had very little design experience. Despite these obstacles, I went on to join a team as the only designer and stayed with one of my teammates who had a place to stay in Santa Barbara. I worked with a great group that went on to earn second place in the competition.
