Pefecting the donut consumption experience for busy people on the go.


# Role
I was involved in designing an impactful mobile app experience for SLO Donut Co, a popular donut shop located less than two miles from Cal Poly’s campus.

# Collaborators

+ [Reginald Lata](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reginaldlata/) - UX Designer
+ [Jenna Iarocci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenna-iarocci/) - UX Designer
+ [Amber Beckley]() - UX Designer

# Context

SLODOCO brings in about $200,000 of revenue every month. It comes to no surprise that this business knows how to attract people and has built a very successful business because of that. 

# Problem

During peak hours, it is not uncommon to see people waiting in lines out the door for as long as an hour just to order a single donut. Because of this demand, popular donuts often sell out quickly. To the consumer, it is a waste of effort and time. In this interaction, there is both a tangible and intangible cost to their business.

# Preface
Before starting the design process, it is important to realize the interactions between a business and its customers. Without this, we are not designing with the users in mind.

# Understanding their business
By interacting with managers, employees, and customers of SLODOCO, here are reoccuring observations:
+ SLODOCO makes the most amount of money from tourists, locals, and college students
+ SLODOCO looks to make the entire experience of buying a donut as effortless as possible
+ Socializing with others improves the experience

# Research 

*Note: To comply with non-disclosure, I have omitted and obfuscated confidential information.*

In attempting to discover more about our users, our research stage took the form of assessing usability of current site, interviewing users, creating a survey, and having users participate in a card sort.


## Usability of Current Site

Common Observations Across Two Different Usability Accessments:
+ Users attempt to click on logo when trying to nagivate home
+ Users attempt to click on donuts
+ Users didn't know that custom orders were possible

## Interviewing Users
Based on where SLODOCO makes the most revenue, it would make the most sense to interview someone from every customer segment. In order to get data that is representative of the population, qualitative data will be collected at different times throughout the day. 

Before asking participants questions, we had them do a three minute priming activity to write or draw anything regarding donuts. After they finish, they would asked about what they created and for what reasons.

From talking to two participants, we affirmed our beliefs:
+ SLODOCO’s target demographic does not like to spend time waiting in line
+ This demographic is typically health-conscious and community-oriented
+ Customers of SLODOCO don’t regularly eat donuts
+ Enjoy the social experience that comes with a brand. 

## Survey

When we interviewed the manager of SLODOCO for our Business Canvas Model, they explained how focusing on tourists would
be beneficial for our research as it would gather many different perspectives. SLODOCO also is aiming to expand their customer base, and tourists are a perfect group to spread the word about the business. 

Because of these reasons, we felt it would be effective to focus on tourists for this survey. However, we made sure to write the survey questions in such a way that the survey could be taken by all focus groups in the future.

The survey proved to give us much insight on customer behaviors overall. The survey answers allude to the fact that it would be beneficial to create an app or mobile game for SLODOCO.

## Card Sort

The user is given a set of cards and the user will try to sort cards with different donuts and activies into time categories that fit the best (Morning, Afternoon, Night, Late-night, Anytime).

![Survey Results](./images/cardsort.jpg)

In terms of responses, we were able to figure out which donuts are prefered during each time of day. The regular donuts are mostly wanted in the morning or at anytime, specialty donuts are wanted more in the afternoon, and the dessert donuts are preferred either at night or late-night.
